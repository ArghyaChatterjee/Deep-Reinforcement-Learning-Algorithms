# Project - MountainCar with Q-learning   

(from Wikipedia)    
Mountain Car, is a problem in which an under-powered car must drive up a steep hill.

Since gravity is stronger than the car's engine, even at full throttle,    
the car cannot simply accelerate up the steep slope. The car is situated in a valley    
and must learn to leverage potential energy by driving up the opposite hill     
before the car is able to make it to the goal at the top of the rightmost hill.   
The domain has been used as a test bed in various Reinforcement Learning papers.
