# Environment   
Usually, solving the environment require an average total reward of over the threshold over 100 consecutive episodes.      
However, in this case the solution is achieved very fastly: in __21 episodes__ in __1 minute__ !  This is due to the fact    
that there are 16 processes in use in this PPO implementation notebook. We can think that the real number of episodes    
is __21x16 = 336__.
