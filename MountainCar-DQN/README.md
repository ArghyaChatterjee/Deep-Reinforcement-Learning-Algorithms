# Project - MountainCar with DQN

### Environment   

Solving the environment require an average total reward of over -110 on 100 consecutive episodes.     
Training of MountainCar is performed using the __Deep Q-Network (DQN)__ algorithm, see    
the basic paper [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning).   
We solve the MountainCar environment in **1835 episodes**, in __1.75__ hours.   
By usage of the Q-learning algorithm, the environment is solved in **283600** episodes in __22 minutes__!
